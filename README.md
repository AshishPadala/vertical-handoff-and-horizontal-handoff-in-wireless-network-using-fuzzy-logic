# Vertical-Handoff-and-Horizontal-Handoff-in-Wireless-Network-using-Fuzzy-Logic

This project presents an integrated framework for managing vertical and horizontal handoffs in wireless networks using a hybrid approach of Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, and Genetic Algorithms (GA). Initially, a Fuzzy Logic-based decision-making system evaluates network parameters—signal strength, latency, and bandwidth—using membership functions and fuzzy rules to determine the suitability of network stations for handoff. Genetic Algorithms are employed to optimize membership function parameters and rule weights, ensuring the system dynamically adapts to varying network conditions.

Building upon the fuzzy decision-making foundation, a Neural Network-based classifier is introduced to enhance handoff decisions. Synthetic data representing network parameters is generated, and the parameters are fuzzified into features for training a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model. The classifier predicts handoff requirements with high accuracy, and GA further optimizes fuzzy feature weights to maximize model performance. The integration of these methodologies ensures seamless connectivity, reduced latency, minimized packet loss, and robust decision-making in dynamic and heterogeneous network environments
